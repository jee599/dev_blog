Claude Code's Agent Teams feature is genuinely impressive. You type a complex prompt, it spawns subagents, they work in parallel, each with its own context window. The architecture is there.

But there's a gap nobody talks about.

Agent Teams doesn't know *which* agents to use. It doesn't know that a game project needs a game designer, a physics engineer, and a QA specialist. It doesn't know that a SaaS dashboard needs a frontend dev, a backend architect, and someone who understands Stripe webhooks. It spawns blank subagents with no identity, no rules, no specialization.

You're supposed to define them yourself. Every time. With `--agents` JSON. For every project.

I built the missing piece.

## 144 Agents, One Command

```bash
npx agentcrow init
```

That's it. This installs 144 specialized agent definitions into your project — 9 hand-crafted builtin agents with strict MUST/MUST NOT rules, plus 135 community agents from [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) covering 15 divisions: engineering, game dev, design, marketing, testing, DevOps, and more.

When you run `claude` after init, it reads the agent roster from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and automatically decomposes your prompt into tasks, matches the right agents, and dispatches them.

No API key needed. No separate server. No configuration. Just Claude Code doing what it already does — but now it knows *who* to call.

---

## What Actually Happens

I typed this:

```
Build a SaaS dashboard with Stripe billing, user auth, and API docs
```

Claude decomposed it into 5 tasks and dispatched 5 specialized agents:

```
🐦 AgentCrow — 5 agents dispatched:
1. @ui_designer      → dashboard layout, component hierarchy
2. @frontend_developer → React components, charts, responsive UI
3. @backend_architect  → Auth system, REST API, Stripe webhooks
4. @qa_engineer        → billing flow E2E tests, auth edge cases
5. @technical_writer   → API reference, onboarding guide
```

Each agent has a defined personality, communication style, and critical rules. The QA engineer, for example, has rules like "MUST cover happy path, edge cases, and error paths" and "MUST NOT skip error handling tests." These aren't suggestions — they're baked into the agent's identity.

The key difference: without AgentCrow, Claude spawns generic subagents. With AgentCrow, each subagent *knows its job*.

## The Comparison Nobody Asked For (But Everyone Needs)

| | Agent Teams alone | + AgentCrow |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Spawn subagents | ✅ | ✅ |
| Know which agents to use | ❌ | ✅ |
| 144 pre-built agent roles | ❌ | ✅ |
| Auto-decompose prompts | ❌ | ✅ |
| Agent identity & rules | ❌ | ✅ |
| Zero config | ❌ | ✅ |

Agent Teams is the engine. AgentCrow is the brain.

## Under the Hood

The architecture is deliberately simple. When you run `npx agentcrow init`, three things happen.

First, 9 builtin agents get copied into `.agr/agents/builtin/`. These are YAML files I wrote by hand. Each one defines a role, personality, MUST rules, MUST NOT rules, deliverables, and success metrics. The QA engineer agent, for example, has 5 MUST rules and 5 MUST NOT rules covering everything from test independence to mock usage.

Second, 135 external agents get cloned from [agency-agents](https://github.com/msitarzewski/agency-agents) into `.agr/agents/external/`. These cover game development (Unreal, Unity, Godot specialists), marketing, sales, spatial computing — domains I wouldn't have thought to include.

Third, a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file gets generated. This is where the magic happens. CLAUDE.md is Claude Code's project-level instruction file — it reads this every session. The generated file contains the complete agent roster and dispatch rules: when to decompose, how to match agents, what format to use for subagent prompts.

A SessionStart hook also gets installed. When you open `claude`, you see:

```
🐦 AgentCrow active
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
9 builtin agents:
  · qa_engineer
  · korean_tech_writer
  · security_auditor_deep
  ...
135 external agents (15 divisions)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Complex prompts → auto agent dispatch
```

The entire system is a CLAUDE.md file and some YAML. No runtime dependencies, no background processes, no API keys. Turn it off with `agentcrow off`, turn it back on with `agentcrow on`.

## What I Learned Building This

The hardest part wasn't the agent matching or the decomposition logic. It was figuring out what *shouldn't* be automated.

My first attempt tried to intercept every prompt, decompose it with an LLM call, and auto-dispatch. The decomposition alone took 15 seconds. For a simple "fix this typo" prompt, that's absurd.

The current design is smarter: CLAUDE.md tells Claude to only decompose multi-task requests. "Fix this bug" runs normally. "Build a dashboard with auth, billing, tests, and docs" triggers the agent system. Claude makes that judgment call — and it's surprisingly good at it.

I also learned that agent identity matters more than I expected. A generic "write tests" subagent produces generic tests. A QA engineer agent with "MUST cover edge cases" and "MUST NOT use sleep for async waits" produces *professional* tests. The rules constrain the model in the right direction.

## Try It

```bash
npx agentcrow init
claude
```

Then type something complex. Watch it decompose and dispatch.
